# Image Upload Feature

This feature allows users to upload images to ImageKit and save the image information in MongoDB using Prisma ORM.

## Status

âœ… **Working Successfully** - Images can now be uploaded to ImageKit and metadata is saved in MongoDB.

## Progress

- [x] Set up Prisma schema with Image model
- [x] Create server actions for image upload
- [x] Create API route for handling uploads
- [x] Create UI components for image upload
- [x] Implement tests for upload functionality
- [x] Add validation for file type and size
- [x] Run tests and verify everything works
- [x] Fix environment variable configuration
- [x] Verify successful image uploads

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema

The `Image` model in the Prisma schema includes:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `url`: URL of the uploaded image
- `fileId`: ImageKit file ID
- `fileName`: Original file name
- `filePath`: File path in ImageKit
- `thumbnailUrl`: Thumbnail URL (if available)
- `size`: File size in bytes
- `width`: Image width
- `height`: Image height
- `format`: Image format/type
- `tags`: Array of tags for the image
- `userId`: Optional relation to the user who uploaded the image
- `createdAt`: When the record was created
- `updatedAt`: When the record was last updated

### Server Actions

- `uploadToImageKit`: Uploads an image to ImageKit
- `saveImageToDatabase`: Saves image information to MongoDB
- `handleImageUpload`: Combines both operations for a complete upload flow

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/upload`: Handles image uploads via API

### UI Components

- `UploadContent`: Client-side React component for image upload with preview and validation
- `UploadPage`: Page component that renders the upload UI

### Validation

- File type validation (only specific image types allowed: jpeg, png, gif, webp, svg+xml)
- File size validation (max 10MB)
- Required fields validation for database storage

## Environment Variables

The feature requires the following environment variables to be set in `.env.local`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT=https://ik.imagekit.io/your_endpoint
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
```

**Note:** Make sure to use the exact variable names as shown above. The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix is required for variables that need to be accessible in browser code.

## Testing

Tests are implemented for:
- Uploading to ImageKit
- Saving to MongoDB
- Complete image upload flow

All tests are passing!

## How to Use

1. Navigate to `/upload` route
2. Click on the upload area to select an image
3. The image will be previewed before upload
4. Click the "Upload" button to upload the image
5. The uploaded image details will be displayed after successful upload

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter upload errors:

1. Verify that all environment variables are correctly set in `.env.local`
2. Check that you're uploading a supported file type (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG)
3. Ensure the file size is under 10MB
4. Check the server logs for more detailed error information
